# Uber-Hackathon
The emergency button (conditional on input: y/n) gives immediate priority to the Uber rider and changes their location to the nearest hospital to avoid exploitation.
The nearest available Uber driver will be notified of the medical emergency, the location of the incident and the location of the nearest hospital.
An extra risk fee (50% of the original ride fare) is paid to the driver by the rider to account for additional cleaning.
